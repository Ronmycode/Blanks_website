# Blanks_website

This was one of the first "complete" static websites that I ever built, is a simple low budget wesite built with only HTML + CSS (sass) + Javascript. Now I'll be giving it a little upgrade just for the purpuse of pracgticing my git skills (and trying to save my showcase a little bit)
